Scratch-pad: {

    Lets you record each medical event in a private blog (encrypted!)

    The code should be able to output a micro-blog (search for day-to-day events)
    or a macro-diary (major trends)

    In the setup enter DoB, hight,  weight and medical history for each parent and grand-parents.
    (until scratch-pad is used by a whole family, then you just link your parents)

    Output daily-recommendations in the micro-calendar, for exercise.

    Parents start this when their child is born so that when both parents have died the 'child' will know what they are inoculated against.

    "Today you should have to do one round of 8-piece brocade."

    Must factor in work. If you go from being a programmer to being a farmer then exercise is dealt with, but possibly stress is not ->meditation/tai chi

Own-school: {
    Guided autodidactic learning.
    Each child is given a tablet-computer and it interactively guages their level at each subject.

    When they are 1 year old it discovers, (and develops) their dexterity and timeing, checks colour-blindness.
    At other ages it will encorage stengths and drop subjects that they show no aptitude for, (though each subject just drops in probability rather than being dropped.)
    
}

Social-standing: {
    This integrates with the other two and your social details and automates social gatherings down to the invitations and the ordering of provisions.
    Also lets people anonymously search for others with similar interests in their geographically local area
}

bypass: {
    Stores password and personal data store, (bank account numbers, pass phrases and other details like that.)
    Can export into keepass,xml,csv,{user defined via a template}
    each bypass password, (and Notice 4.0 people.pe_password) is randomly generated and locked, (hashed) using the users password, (people.pe_passwd). 
    if the user wants they can use http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Secret_sharing on the underlying password: {
        normally they would create one share for each significant friend and family member and one for their laywer.
        bypass will suggest a sensible quarum needed by the group after they are dead. 
        After they have not logged in for {user defined length, e.g. one week} the quarum can gather to enter their share to access the data/passwords
    }
