Notice

Notice is interesting for at least two reasons, (possibly more).

First it is an example of a light MVC framework. I started out by looking at the largest most popular MVC framework in CPAN; 
it is great, but I needed something lighter, so I started looking for the lightest. I found a collection of tutorials, but
never quite the full combination that I needed, (actually I wanted L18n as well but I did not have time when I was creating
this third incarnation for Notice. xkcd.com/974/)

Second I was spending a weekend building a domain registry, (it really isn't that hard) and needed a whois server; I could
find an almost endless collection of code to talk to/with a whois server, but not actually a whois daemon. So in the S of 
Model, View, Control, Sundries is a little RFC3912 compliant whois daemon. If you create a CDB file with a key of 
awesome.gb.com and a value of "Why YOU are my friend, you are!" this daemon will serve it up for you. 

The unsuspecting world should know that this version is NOT an example of perfect code, (feel free to improve it or make a
version with the features that you need, e.g. L18n) but it will save you time if you need an example of these features, or
a whois server.

Catalyst seems like the daddy-bear of frame-works, and all the others seemed like mummy-bear, so Notice is my baby-bear;
  I hope that someone else will think that it is 'just right'.
