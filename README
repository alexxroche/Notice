Notice - A MVC (DBIC,TT,CAS) CGI::Application Customer Resource and Account Manager inspired by C:A:Structured

C:A:S got a lot of things right but I prefer not to name my runmodes after perl functions. i.e. 
sub main: StartRunmode{ } #seems better than the default of sub index: StartRunmode{ }

I had a hard time getting sessions; authentication; dispatch; query (the cgi query) all working at
the same time with C:A:S. That said I'm very greatful for C:A:S in my transition from Catalyst to CGI:App

Is it $self or $c ? I've chosen $self

If you have just cloned this from github then you might have to install the deps; You can do this with

    sudo cpanm --installdeps .  

If you have that installed or 

    for i in `grep :: Makefile.PL|grep -v '>='|sed -e 's/^use //g' -e "s/^\s*'//g" -e "s/'.*//g" -e 's/;$//'`;do sudo perl -MCPAN -e "install $i"; done

INSTALLATION

CHANGE the default password in config/config.pl
    
Create the database:

    ./script/create_notice_db.pl

Then 
    cp config t/cgi-bin/* /var/www/sites/www.example.com/cgi-bin/  #or where ever your cgi-bin is
    cp t/www/* /var/www/sites/www.example.com/www/          #or where ever your www is

(This is why the TT templates are in t/cgi-bin/templates.)

To install this module, I run the following commands:

	perl Makefile.PL
	make
	make test
	sudo make install

Test the install (default login is with a@b.com with a password of 123Abc).

If you forgot to change the db_pw in config:

CHANGE the password in ~www/cgi-bin/config/config.pl and in the the db to match:
    mysql -p mysql
    mysql> update user set password=PASSWORD('NEW-PASSWORD') where User='notice_adminuser';

BUGS and LIMITATIONS

Notice should check for a valid DB and offer to install via https if $CFG{installing}=1;
