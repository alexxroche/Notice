Notice

Notice - A MVC (DBIC,TT,CAS) CGI::Application Customer Resource and Account Manager inspired by C:A:Structured

C:A:S got a lot of things right but I prefer not to name my runmodes after perl functions. i.e. 
<<<<<<< HEAD:README
sub main: StartRunmode{ } #seems better than the default of sub index: StartRunmode{ }
=======
sub main: StartRunmode{ } #seems better than the default
sub index: StartRunmode{ } #seems better than the default
>>>>>>> master:README

I had a hard time getting sessions; authentication; dispatch; query (the cgi query) all working at
the same time with C:A:S. That said I'm very greatful for C:A:S in my transition from Catalyst to CGI:App

Is it $self or $c ? I've chosen $self

INSTALLATION
    
Create a database called notice and use the details from config/config.pl to grant a user then
    mysql notice < config/notice.mysql
You create the DBIC::schema using
    ./script/create_dbic_schema.pl
Then 
    cp config t/cgi-bin/* /var/www/sites/www.example.com/cgi-bin/  #or where ever your cgi-bin is
    cp t/www/* /var/www/sites/www.example.com/www/          #or where ever your www is

To install this module, I run the following commands:

	perl Makefile.PL
	make
	make test
	sudo make install

Test the install (default login is with a@b.com with a password of 123Abc) and if it works
CHANGE the password in ~www/cgi-bin/config/config.pl and in the the db to match:
    mysql -p mysql
    mysql> update user set password=PASSWORD('NEW-PASSWORD') where User='notice_adminuser';
